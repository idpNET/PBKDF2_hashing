## About The Project

This project provides a relatively decent and customizable hashing method using PBKDF2 (+ strong salting) and SHA256 hashing algorithm. Settable hashing and salting keys' size, along with the hashsing iteration times are some of the capabilities of the project.  

Main Capabilities:

* PBKDF2 Hashing + SHA256 Hashing Algorithm
* Strong Salting (an array of bytes with a cryptographically strong sequence of random nonzero values)
* Customizable Hashing and salting Keys' size + hashing iteration times.
* Hashing process time tracking.

### Installation

1. Clone the repo in visual studio
```sh
https://github.com/idpNET/PBKDF2_hashing.git
```
2. Run the app and Get Started!

## Usage

Running the console app, you get prompted to enter the input password for hashing process (default password is 'default'). Next, you get prompted to enter the iteration value of hashing process (default is 1000). Hitting enter button, you get final results including the entered password, password hash value, salt value and the process time.

P.S This project is well commented ! You can refer to the inline code comments for more information
